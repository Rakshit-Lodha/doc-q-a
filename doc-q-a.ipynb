I have seldom heard him men-\\ntion her under any other name. In his\\neyes she eclipses and predominates the\\nwhole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emo-\\ntion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and\\nthat one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold,\\nprecise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I\\ntake it, the most perfect reasoning and observing\\nmachine that the world has seen, but as a lover he\\nwould have placed himself in a false position. He\\nnever spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\\nand a sneer. They were admirable things for the ob-\\nserver—excellent for drawing the veil from men’s\\nmotives and actions. But for the trained reasoner\\nto admit such intrusions into his own delicate and\\nﬁnely adjusted temperament was to introduce a dis-\\ntracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all\\nhis mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or\\na crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would\\nnot be more disturbing than a strong emotion in\\na nature such as his. And yet there was but one\\nwoman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\\nAdler, of dubious and questionable memory.\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage\\nhad drifted us away from each other. My own\\ncomplete happiness, and the home-centred inter-\\nests which rise up around the man who ﬁrst ﬁnds\\nhimself master of his own establishment, were suf-\\nﬁcient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes,\\nwho loathed every form of society with his whole\\nBohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker\\nStreet, buried among his old books, and alternating\\nfrom week to week between cocaine and ambition,\\nthe drowsiness of the drug, and the ﬁerce energy of\\nhis own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply\\nattracted by the study of crime, and occupied his\\nimmense faculties and extraordinary powers of ob-\\nservation in following out those clues, and clearing\\nup those mysteries which had been abandoned as\\nhopeless by the ofﬁcial police. From time to time\\nI heard some vague account of his doings: of his\\nsummons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff mur-\\nder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of\\nthe Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and ﬁnally\\nof the mission which he had accomplished so del-\\nicately and successfully for the reigning family of\\nHolland. Beyond these signs of his activity, how-\\never, which I merely shared with all the readers of\\nthe daily press, I knew little of my former friend\\nand companion.\\nOne night—it was on the twentieth of March,\\n1888—I was returning from a journey to a patient\\n(for I had now returned to civil practice), when\\nmy way led me through Baker Street. As I passed\\nthe well-remembered door, which must always be\\nassociated in my mind with my wooing, and with\\nthe dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was\\nseized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and\\nto know how he was employing his extraordinary\\npowers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as\\nI looked up, I saw his tall, spare ﬁgure pass twice in\\na dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing\\nthe room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon\\nhis chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me,\\nwho knew his every mood and habit, his attitude\\nand manner told their own story. He was at work\\nagain. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams\\nand was hot upon the scent of some new problem.\\nI rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber\\nwhich had formerly been in part my own.\\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was;\\nbut he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a\\nword spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me\\nto an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and\\nindicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner.\\nThen he stood before the ﬁre and looked me over\\nin his singular introspective fashion.\\n“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think,\\nWatson, that you have put on seven and a half\\npounds since I saw you.”\\n“Seven!” I answered.\\n“Indeed, I should have thought a little more.\\nJust a triﬂe more, I fancy, Watson. And in prac-\\ntice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you\\nintended to go into harness.”\\n“Then, how do you know?”\\n“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you\\nhave been getting yourself very wet lately, and that\\nyou have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?”\\n“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much.\\nYou would certainly have been burned, had you\\nlived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a\\ncountry walk on Thursday and came home in a\\ndreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes\\nI can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her\\nnotice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work\\nit out.”\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long,\\nnervous hands together.\\n“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me\\nthat on the inside of your left shoe, just where the\\nﬁrelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost\\nparallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\\n3\\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round\\nthe edges of the sole in order to remove crusted\\nmud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction\\nthat you had been out in vile weather, and that you\\nhad a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen\\nof the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gen-\\ntleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform,\\nwith a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\\nforeﬁnger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-\\nhat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope,\\nI must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him\\nto be an active member of the medical profession.”\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which\\nhe explained his process of deduction. “When I\\nhear you give your reasons,” I remarked, “the thing\\nalways appears to me to be so ridiculously simple\\nthat I could easily do it myself, though at each\\nsuccessive instance of your reasoning I am bafﬂed\\nuntil you explain your process. And yet I believe\\nthat my eyes are as good as yours.”\\n“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette,\\nand throwing himself down into an armchair. “You\\nsee, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.\\nFor example, you have frequently seen the steps\\nwhich lead up from the hall to this room.”\\n“Frequently.”\\n“How often?”\\n“Well, some hundreds of times.”\\n“Then how many are there?”\\n“How many? I don’t know.”\\n“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you\\nhave seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that\\nthere are seventeen steps, because I have both seen\\nand observed. By-the-way, since you are interested\\nin these little problems, and since you are good\\nenough to chronicle one or two of my triﬂing expe-\\nriences, you may be interested in this.” He threw\\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which\\nhad been lying open upon the table. “It came by\\nthe last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\\nThe note was undated, and without either sig-\\nnature or address.\\n“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter\\nto eight o’clock,” it said, “a gentleman who desires\\nto consult you upon a matter of the very deepest\\nmoment. Your recent services to one of the royal\\nhouses of Europe have shown that you are one who\\nmay safely be trusted with matters which are of an\\nimportance which can hardly be exaggerated. This\\naccount of you we have from all quarters received.\\nBe in your chamber then at that hour, and do not\\ntake it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.”\\n“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What\\ndo you imagine that it means?”\\n“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to\\ntheorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins\\nto twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to\\nsuit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce\\nfrom it?”\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper\\nupon which it was written.\\n“The man who wrote it was presumably well\\nto do,” I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my\\ncompanion’s processes. “Such paper could not be\\nbought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly\\nstrong and stiff.”\\n“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes.\\n“It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the\\nlight.”\\nI did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,”\\na “P ,” and a large “G” with a small “t” woven into\\nthe texture of the paper.\\n“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\\n“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his mono-\\ngram, rather.”\\n“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for\\n‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the German for ‘Company.’\\nIt is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P ,’ of\\ncourse, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us\\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down\\na heavy brown volume from his shelves. “Eglow,\\nEglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a German-\\nspeaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carls-\\nbad. ‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death\\nof Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories\\nand paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you\\nmake of that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a\\ngreat blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.\\n“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\\n“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is\\na German. Do you note the peculiar construction of\\nthe sentence—‘This account of you we have from all\\nquarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could\\nnot have written that. It is the German who is so\\nuncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore,\\nto discover what is wanted by this German who\\nwrites upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing\\na mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if\\nI am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.”\\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of\\nhorses’ hoofs and grating wheels against the curb,\\nfollowed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whis-\\ntled.\\n“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he con-\\ntinued, glancing out of the window. “A nice little\\nbrougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and\\n4\\nﬁfty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case,\\nWatson, if there is nothing else.”\\n“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”\\n“Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am\\nlost without my Boswell. And this promises to be\\ninteresting. It would be a pity to miss it.”\\n“But your client—”\\n“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so\\nmay he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair,\\nDoctor, and give us your best attention.”\\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard\\nupon the stairs and in the passage, paused immedi-\\nately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\\nauthoritative tap.\\n“Come in!” said Holmes.\\nA man entered who could hardly have been less\\nthan six feet six inches in height, with the chest and\\nlimbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a rich-\\nness which would, in England, be looked upon as\\nakin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were\\nslashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-\\nbreasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\\nthrown over his shoulders was lined with ﬂame-\\ncoloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch\\nwhich consisted of a single ﬂaming beryl. Boots\\nwhich extended halfway up his calves, and which\\nwere trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, com-\\npleted the impression of barbaric opulence which\\nwas suggested by his whole appearance. He carried\\na broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore\\nacross the upper part of his face, extending down\\npast the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which\\nhe had apparently adjusted that very moment, for\\nhis hand was still raised to it as he entered. From\\nthe lower part of the face he appeared to be a man\\nof strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a\\nlong, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed\\nto the length of obstinacy.\\n“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh\\nvoice and a strongly marked German accent. “I told\\nyou that I would call.” He looked from one to the\\nother of us, as if uncertain which to address.\\n“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my\\nfriend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasion-\\nally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\\nhave I the honour to address?”\\n“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm,\\na Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gen-\\ntleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discre-\\ntion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most\\nextreme importance. If not, I should much prefer\\nto communicate with you alone.”\\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist\\nand pushed me back into my chair. “It is both, or\\nnone,” said he. “You may say before this gentleman\\nanything which you may say to me.”\\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders.\\n“Then I must begin,” said he, “by binding you both\\nto absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\\nthat time the matter will be of no importance. At\\npresent it is not too much to say that it is of such\\nweight it may have an inﬂuence upon European\\nhistory.”\\n“I promise,” said Holmes.\\n“And I.”\\n“You will excuse this mask,” continued our\\nstrange visitor. “The august person who employs\\nme wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I\\nmay confess at once that the title by which I have\\njust called myself is not exactly my own.”\\n“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.\\n“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and\\nevery precaution has to be taken to quench what\\nmight grow to be an immense scandal and seriously\\ncompromise one of the reigning families of Europe.\\nTo speak plainly, the matter implicates the great\\nHouse of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.”\\n“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes,\\nsettling himself down in his armchair and closing\\nhis eyes.\\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent sur-\\nprise at the languid, lounging ﬁgure of the man\\nwho had been no doubt depicted to him as the\\nmost incisive reasoner and most energetic agent\\nin Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and\\nlooked impatiently at his gigantic client.\\n“If your Majesty would condescend to state your\\ncase,” he remarked, “I should be better able to ad-\\nvise you.”\\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up\\nand down the room in uncontrollable agitation.\\nThen, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the\\nmask from his face and hurled it upon the ground.\\n“You are right,” he cried; “I am the King. Why\\nshould I attempt to conceal it?”\\n“Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your\\nMajesty had not spoken before I was aware that\\nI was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond\\nvon Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and\\nhereditary King of Bohemia.”\\n“But you can understand,” said our strange vis-\\nitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand\\nover his high white forehead, “you can understand\\nthat I am not accustomed to doing such business in\\nmy own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that\\nI could not conﬁde it to an agent without putting\\n5\\nmyself in his power. I have come incognito from\\nPrague for the purpose of consulting you.”\\n“Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his\\neyes once more.\\n“The facts are brieﬂy these: Some ﬁve years\\nago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the\\nacquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene\\nAdler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.”\\n“Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” mur-\\nmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many\\nyears he had adopted a system of docketing all para-\\ngraphs concerning men and things, so that it was\\ndifﬁcult to name a subject or a person on which he\\ncould not at once furnish information. In this case\\nI found her biography sandwiched in between that\\nof a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander\\nwho had written a monograph upon the deep-sea\\nﬁshes.\\n“Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in\\nNew Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto—hum! La\\nScala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of War-\\nsaw—yes! Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living\\nin London—quite so! Your Majesty, as I under-\\nstand, became entangled with this young person,\\nwrote her some compromising letters, and is now\\ndesirous of getting those letters back.”\\n“Precisely so. But how—”\\n“Was there a secret marriage?”\\n“None.”\\n“No legal papers or certiﬁcates?”\\n“None.”\\n“Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young\\nperson should produce her letters for blackmailing\\nor other purposes, how is she to prove their authen-\\nticity?”\\n“There is the writing.”\\n“Pooh, pooh! Forgery.”\\n“My private note-paper.”\\n“Stolen.”\\n“My own seal.”\\n“Imitated.”\\n“My photograph.”\\n“Bought.”\\n“We were both in the photograph.”\\n“Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has\\nindeed committed an indiscretion.”\\n“I was mad—insane.”\\n“You have compromised yourself seriously.”\\n“I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I\\nam but thirty now.”\\n“It must be recovered.”\\n“We have tried and failed.”\\n“Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.”\\n“She will not sell.”\\n“Stolen, then.”\\n“Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars\\nin my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted\\nher luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been\\nwaylaid. There has been no result.”\\n“No sign of it?”\\n“Absolutely none.”\\nHolmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little prob-\\nlem,” said he.\\n“But a very serious one to me,” returned the\\nKing reproachfully.\\n“Very, indeed. And what does she propose to\\ndo with the photograph?”\\n“To ruin me.”\\n“But how?”\\n“I am about to be married.”\\n“So I have heard.”\\n“To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, sec-\\nond daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may\\nknow the strict principles of her family. She is her-\\nself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt\\nas to my conduct would bring the matter to an\\nend.”\\n“And Irene Adler?”\\n“Threatens to send them the photograph. And\\nshe will do it. I know that she will do it. You do\\nnot know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has\\nthe face of the most beautiful of women, and the\\nmind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I\\nshould marry another woman, there are no lengths\\nto which she would not go—none.”\\n“You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”\\n“I am sure.”\\n“And why?”\\n“Because she has said that she would send it\\non the day when the betrothal was publicly pro-\\nclaimed. That will be next Monday.”\\n“Oh, then we have three days yet,” said Holmes\\nwith a yawn. “That is very fortunate, as I have\\none or two matters of importance to look into just\\nat present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in\\nLondon for the present?”\\n“Certainly. You will ﬁnd me at the Langham\\nunder the name of the Count Von Kramm.”\\n“Then I shall drop you a line to let you know\\nhow we progress.”\\n6\\n“Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.”\\n“Then, as to money?”\\n“You have carte blanche.”\\n“Absolutely?”\\n“I tell you that I would give one of the provinces\\nof my kingdom to have that photograph.”\\n“And for present expenses?”\\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from\\nunder his cloak and laid it on the table.\\n“There are three hundred pounds in gold and\\nseven hundred in notes,” he said.\\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his\\nnote-book and handed it to him.\\n“And Mademoiselle’s address?” he asked.\\n“Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s\\nWood.”\\nHolmes took a note of it. “One other question,”\\nsaid he. “Was the photograph a cabinet?”\\n“It was.”\\n“Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust\\nthat we shall soon have some good news for you.\\nAnd good-night, Watson,” he added, as the wheels\\nof the royal brougham rolled down the street. “If\\nyou will be good enough to call to-morrow after-\\nnoon at three o’clock I should like to chat this little\\nmatter over with you.”\\nCHAPTER II.\\nAt three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street,\\nbut Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady in-\\nformed me that he had left the house shortly after\\neight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the\\nﬁre, however, with the intention of awaiting him,\\nhowever long he might be. I was already deeply\\ninterested in his inquiry, for, though it was sur-\\nrounded by none of the grim and strange features\\nwhich were associated with the two crimes which I\\nhave already recorded, still, the nature of the case\\nand the exalted station of his client gave it a charac-\\nter of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there\\nwas something in his masterly grasp of a situation,\\nand his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a\\npleasure to me to study his system of work, and\\nto follow the quick, subtle methods by which he\\ndisentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So\\naccustomed was I to his invariable success that the\\nvery possibility of his failing had ceased to enter\\ninto my head.\\nIt was close upon four before the door opened,\\nand a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-\\nwhiskered, with an inﬂamed face and disreputable\\nclothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I\\nwas to my friend’s amazing powers in the use of\\ndisguises, I had to look three times before I was\\ncertain that it was indeed he. With a nod he van-\\nished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in ﬁve\\nminutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.\\nPutting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out\\nhis legs in front of the ﬁre and laughed heartily for\\nsome minutes.\\n“Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and\\nlaughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp\\nand helpless, in the chair.\\n“What is it?”\\n“It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never\\nguess how I employed my morning, or what I\\nended by doing.”\\n“I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been\\nwatching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss\\nIrene Adler.”\\n“Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I\\nwill tell you, however. I left the house a little af-\\nter eight o’clock this morning in the character of a\\ngroom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy\\nand freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of\\nthem, and you will know all that there is to know. I\\nsoon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a\\ngarden at the back, but built out in front right up to\\nthe road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large\\nsitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with\\nlong windows almost to the ﬂoor, and those pre-\\nposterous English window fasteners which a child\\ncould open. Behind there was nothing remarkable,\\nsave that the passage window could be reached\\nfrom the top of the coach-house. I walked round it\\nand examined it closely from every point of view,\\nbut without noting anything else of interest.\\n7\\n“I then lounged down the street and found, as\\nI expected, that there was a mews in a lane which\\nruns down by one wall of the garden. I lent the\\nostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and\\nreceived in exchange twopence, a glass of half and\\nhalf, two ﬁlls of shag tobacco, and as much infor-\\nmation as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say\\nnothing of half a dozen other people in the neigh-\\nbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested,\\nbut whose biographies I was compelled to listen\\nto.”\\n“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.\\n“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down\\nin that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bon-\\nnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to\\na man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives\\nout at ﬁve every day, and returns at seven sharp\\nfor dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except\\nwhen she sings. Has only one male visitor, but\\na good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and\\ndashing, never calls less than once a day, and often\\ntwice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner\\nTemple. See the advantages of a cabman as a con-\\nﬁdant. They had driven him home a dozen times\\nfrom Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.\\nWhen I had listened to all they had to tell, I began\\nto walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more,\\nand to think over my plan of campaign.\\n“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an impor-\\ntant factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That\\nsounded ominous. What was the relation between\\nthem, and what the object of his repeated visits?\\nWas she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If\\nthe former, she had probably transferred the photo-\\ngraph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely.\\nOn the issue of this question depended whether I\\nshould continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn\\nmy attention to the gentleman’s chambers in the\\nTemple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the\\nﬁeld of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these\\ndetails, but I have to let you see my little difﬁculties,\\nif you are to understand the situation.”\\n“I am following you closely,” I answered.\\n“I was still balancing the matter in my mind\\nwhen a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge,\\nand a gentleman sprang out. He was a remark-\\nably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and mous-\\ntached—evidently the man of whom I had heard.\\nHe appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the\\ncabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who\\nopened the door with the air of a man who was\\nthoroughly at home.\\n“He was in the house about half an hour, and\\nI could catch glimpses of him in the windows of\\nthe sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking ex-\\ncitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see\\nnothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more\\nﬂurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab,\\nhe pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked\\nat it earnestly, ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted,\\n‘ﬁrst to Gross & Hankey’s in Regent Street, and\\nthen to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware\\nRoad. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’\\n“Away they went, and I was just wondering\\nwhether I should not do well to follow them when\\nup the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman\\nwith his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under\\nhis ear, while all the tags of his harness were stick-\\ning out of the buckles. It hadn’t pulled up before\\nshe shot out of the hall door and into it. I only\\ncaught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was\\na lovely woman, with a face that a man might die\\nfor.\\n“ ‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried,\\n‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty min-\\nutes.’\\n“This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I\\nwas just balancing whether I should run for it, or\\nwhether I should perch behind her landau when\\na cab came through the street. The driver looked\\ntwice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before\\nhe could object. ‘The Church of St. Monica,’ said\\nI, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty\\nminutes.’ It was twenty-ﬁve minutes to twelve, and\\nof course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\\n“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove\\nfaster, but the others were there before us. The cab\\nand the landau with their steaming horses were in\\nfront of the door when I arrived. I paid the man\\nand hurried into the church. There was not a soul\\nthere save the two whom I had followed and a\\nsurpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostu-\\nlating with them. They were all three standing in\\na knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side\\naisle like any other idler who has dropped into a\\nchurch. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the\\naltar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came\\nrunning as hard as he could towards me.\\n“ ‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come!\\nCome!’\\n“ ‘What then?’ I asked.\\n“ ‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it\\nwon’t be legal.’\\n“I was half-dragged up to the altar, and be-\\nfore I knew where I was I found myself mumbling\\nresponses which were whispered in my ear, and\\nvouching for things of which I knew nothing, and\\ngenerally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene\\n8\\nAdler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was\\nall done in an instant, and there was the gentleman\\nthanking me on the one side and the lady on the\\nother, while the clergyman beamed on me in front.\\nIt was the most preposterous position in which I\\never found myself in my life, and it was the thought\\nof it that started me laughing just now. It seems\\nthat there had been some informality about their\\nlicense, that the clergyman absolutely refused to\\nmarry them without a witness of some sort, and\\nthat my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom\\nfrom having to sally out into the streets in search\\nof a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and\\nI mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of\\nthe occasion.”\\n“This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said\\nI; “and what then?”\\n“Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced.\\nIt looked as if the pair might take an immediate\\ndeparture, and so necessitate very prompt and en-\\nergetic measures on my part. At the church door,\\nhowever, they separated, he driving back to the\\nTemple, and she to her own house. ‘I shall drive\\nout in the park at ﬁve as usual,’ she said as she\\nleft him. I heard no more. They drove away in dif-\\nferent directions, and I went off to make my own\\narrangements.”\\n“Which are?”\\n“Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he an-\\nswered, ringing the bell. “I have been too busy\\nto think of food, and I am likely to be busier still\\nthis evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your\\nco-operation.”\\n“I shall be delighted.”\\n“You don’t mind breaking the law?”\\n“Not in the least.”\\n“Nor running a chance of arrest?”\\n“Not in a good cause.”\\n“Oh, the cause is excellent!”\\n“Then I am your man.”\\n“I was sure that I might rely on you.”\\n“But what is it you wish?”\\n“When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I\\nwill make it clear to you. Now,” he said as he\\nturned hungrily on the simple fare that our land-\\nlady had provided, “I must discuss it while I eat,\\nfor I have not much time. It is nearly ﬁve now. In\\ntwo hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss\\nIrene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at\\nseven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.”\\n“And what then?”\\n“You must leave that to me. I have already ar-\\nranged what is to occur. There is only one point on\\nwhich I must insist. You must not interfere, come\\nwhat may. You understand?”\\n“I am to be neutral?”\\n“To do nothing whatever. There will probably\\nbe some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it.\\nIt will end in my being conveyed into the house.\\nFour or ﬁve minutes afterwards the sitting-room\\nwindow will open. You are to station yourself close\\nto that open window.”\\n“Yes.”\\n“You are to watch me, for I will be visible to\\nyou.”\\n“Yes.”\\n“And when I raise my hand—so—you will\\nthrow into the room what I give you to throw, and\\nwill, at the same time, raise the cry of ﬁre. You\\nquite follow me?”\\n“Entirely.”\\n“It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking\\na long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. “It is an\\nordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, ﬁtted with a cap\\nat either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is\\nconﬁned to that. When you raise your cry of ﬁre, it\\nwill be taken up by quite a number of people. You\\nmay then walk to the end of the street, and I will\\nrejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made\\nmyself clear?”\\n“I am to remain neutral, to get near the window,\\nto watch you, and at the signal to throw in this\\nobject, then to raise the cry of ﬁre, and to wait you\\nat the corner of the street.”\\n“Precisely.”\\n“Then you may entirely rely on me.”\\n“That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost\\ntime that I prepare for the new role I have to play.”\\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned\\nin a few minutes in the character of an amiable\\nand simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His\\nbroad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie,\\nhis sympathetic smile, and general look of peering\\nand benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John\\nHare alone could have equalled. It was not merely\\nthat Holmes changed his costume. His expression,\\nhis manner, his very soul seemed to vary with ev-\\nery fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a ﬁne\\nactor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when\\nhe became a specialist in crime.\\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker\\nStreet, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour\\nwhen we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It\\nwas already dusk, and the lamps were just being\\n9\\nlighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony\\nLodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The\\nhouse was just such as I had pictured it from Sher-\\nlock Holmes’ succinct description, but the locality\\nappeared to be less private than I expected. On\\nthe contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbour-\\nhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a\\ngroup of shabbily dressed men smoking and laugh-\\ning in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel,\\ntwo guardsmen who were ﬂirting with a nurse-\\ngirl, and several well-dressed young men who were\\nlounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.\\n“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to\\nand fro in front of the house, “this marriage rather\\nsimpliﬁes matters. The photograph becomes a\\ndouble-edged weapon now. The chances are that\\nshe would be as averse to its being seen by Mr.\\nGodfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the\\neyes of his princess. Now the question is—Where\\nare we to ﬁnd the photograph?”\\n“Where, indeed?”\\n“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with\\nher. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy conceal-\\nment about a woman’s dress. She knows that the\\nKing is capable of having her waylaid and searched.\\nTwo attempts of the sort have already been made.\\nWe may take it, then, that she does not carry it\\nabout with her.”\\n“Where, then?”\\n“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that dou-\\nble possibility. But I am inclined to think neither.\\nWomen are naturally secretive, and they like to do\\ntheir own secreting. Why should she hand it over\\nto anyone else? She could trust her own guardian-\\nship, but she could not tell what indirect or political\\ninﬂuence might be brought to bear upon a business\\nman. Besides, remember that she had resolved to\\nuse it within a few days. It must be where she\\ncan lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own\\nhouse.”\\n“But it has twice been burgled.”\\n“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”\\n“But how will you look?”\\n“I will not look.”\\n“What then?”\\n“I will get her to show me.”\\n“But she will refuse.”\\n“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble\\nof wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my\\norders to the letter.”\\nAs he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a\\ncarriage came round the curve of the avenue. It\\nwas a smart little landau which rattled up to the\\ndoor of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the\\nloaﬁng men at the corner dashed forward to open\\nthe door in the hope of earning a copper, but was\\nelbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed\\nup with the same intention. A ﬁerce quarrel broke\\nout, which was increased by the two guardsmen,\\nwho took sides with one of the loungers, and by\\nthe scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the\\nother side. A blow was struck, and in an instant\\nthe lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was\\nthe centre of a little knot of ﬂushed and struggling\\nmen, who struck savagely at each other with their\\nﬁsts and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd\\nto protect the lady; but just as he reached her he\\ngave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the\\nblood running freely down his face. At his fall\\nthe guardsmen took to their heels in one direction\\nand the loungers in the other, while a number of\\nbetter-dressed people, who had watched the scufﬂe\\nwithout taking part in it, crowded in to help the\\nlady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler,\\nas I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but\\nshe stood at the top with her superb ﬁgure outlined\\nagainst the lights of the hall, looking back into the\\nstreet.\\n“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.\\n“He is dead,” cried several voices.\\n“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another.\\n“But he’ll be gone before you can get him to hospi-\\ntal.”\\n“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They\\nwould have had the lady’s purse and watch if it\\nhadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a\\nrough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”\\n“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in,\\nmarm?”\\n“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There\\nis a comfortable sofa. This way, please!”\\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony\\nLodge and laid out in the principal room, while\\nI still observed the proceedings from my post by\\nthe window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds\\nhad not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as\\nhe lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he\\nwas seized with compunction at that moment for\\nthe part he was playing, but I know that I never felt\\nmore heartily ashamed of myself in my life than\\nwhen I saw the beautiful creature against whom I\\nwas conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with\\nwhich she waited upon the injured man. And yet it\\nwould be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw\\nback now from the part which he had intrusted\\n10\\nto me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-\\nrocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought,\\nwe are not injuring her. We are but preventing her\\nfrom injuring another.\\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw\\nhim motion like a man who is in need of air. A\\nmaid rushed across and threw open the window.\\nAt the same instant I saw him raise his hand and\\nat the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with\\na cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out of my\\nmouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well\\ndressed and ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-\\nmaids—joined in a general shriek of “Fire!” Thick\\nclouds of smoke curled through the room and out\\nat the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing\\nﬁgures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes\\nfrom within assuring them that it was a false alarm.\\nSlipping through the shouting crowd I made my\\nway to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes\\nwas rejoiced to ﬁnd my friend’s arm in mine, and\\nto get away from the scene of uproar. He walked\\nswiftly and in silence for some few minutes until\\nwe had turned down one of the quiet streets which\\nlead towards the Edgeware Road.\\n“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked.\\n“Nothing could have been better. It is all right.”\\n“You have the photograph?”\\n“I know where it is.”\\n“And how did you ﬁnd out?”\\n“She showed me, as I told you she would.”\\n“I am still in the dark.”\\n“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he,\\nlaughing. “The matter was perfectly simple. You,\\nof course, saw that everyone in the street was an ac-\\ncomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\\n“I guessed as much.”\\n“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little\\nmoist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed\\nforward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face,\\nand became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\\n“That also I could fathom.”\\n“Then they carried me in. She was bound to\\nhave me in. What else could she do? And into\\nher sitting-room, which was the very room which\\nI suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom,\\nand I was determined to see which. They laid me\\non a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled\\nto open the window, and you had your chance.”\\n“How did that help you?”\\n“It was all-important. When a woman thinks\\nthat her house is on ﬁre, her instinct is at once to\\nrush to the thing which she values most. It is a\\nperfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more\\nthan once taken advantage of it. In the case of the\\nDarlington substitution scandal it was of use to me,\\nand also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A mar-\\nried woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one\\nreaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me\\nthat our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\\nmore precious to her than what we are in quest of.\\nShe would rush to secure it. The alarm of ﬁre was\\nadmirably done. The smoke and shouting were\\nenough to shake nerves of steel. She responded\\nbeautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind\\na sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She\\nwas there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of\\nit as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it\\nwas a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the\\nrocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen\\nher since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped\\nfrom the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to\\nsecure the photograph at once; but the coachman\\nhad come in, and as he was watching me narrowly\\nit seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance\\nmay ruin all.”\\n“And now?” I asked.\\n“Our quest is practically ﬁnished. I shall call\\nwith the King to-morrow, and with you, if you\\ncare to come with us. We will be shown into the\\nsitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable\\nthat when she comes she may ﬁnd neither us nor\\nthe photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his\\nMajesty to regain it with his own hands.”\\n“And when will you call?”\\n“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so\\nthat we shall have a clear ﬁeld. Besides, we must\\nbe prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete\\nchange in her life and habits. I must wire to the\\nKing without delay.”\\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped\\nat the door. He was searching his pockets for the\\nkey when someone passing said:\\n“Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.”\\nThere were several people on the pavement at\\nthe time, but the greeting appeared to come from a\\nslim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\\n“I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, star-\\ning down the dimly lit street. “Now, I wonder who\\nthe deuce that could have been.”\\n11\\nCHAPTER III.\\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were\\nengaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning\\nwhen the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\\n“You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sher-\\nlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly\\ninto his face.\\n“Not yet.”\\n“But you have hopes?”\\n“I have hopes.”\\n“Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.”\\n“We must have a cab.”\\n“No, my brougham is waiting.”\\n“Then that will simplify matters.” We de-\\nscended and started off once more for Briony\\nLodge.\\n“Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes.\\n“Married! When?”\\n“Yesterday.”\\n“But to whom?”\\n“To an English lawyer named Norton.”\\n“But she could not love him.”\\n“I am in hopes that she does.”\\n“And why in hopes?”\\n“Because it would spare your Majesty all fear\\nof future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband,\\nshe does not love your Majesty. If she does not love\\nyour Majesty, there is no reason why she should\\ninterfere with your Majesty’s plan.”\\n“It is true. And yet—Well! I wish she had been\\nof my own station! What a queen she would have\\nmade!” He relapsed into a moody silence, which\\nwas not broken until we drew up in Serpentine\\nAvenue.\\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an\\nelderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched\\nus with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\\nbrougham.\\n“Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she.\\n“I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion,\\nlooking at her with a questioning and rather star-\\ntled gaze.\\n“Indeed! My mistress told me that you were\\nlikely to call. She left this morning with her hus-\\nband by the 5.15 train from Charing Cross for the\\nContinent.”\\n“What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white\\nwith chagrin and surprise. “Do you mean that she\\nhas left England?”\\n“Never to return.”\\n“And the papers?” asked the King hoarsely.\\n“All is lost.”\\n“We shall see.” He pushed past the servant\\nand rushed into the drawing-room, followed by\\nthe King and myself. The furniture was scattered\\nabout in every direction, with dismantled shelves\\nand open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ran-\\nsacked them before her ﬂight. Holmes rushed at\\nthe bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,\\nplunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and\\na letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler her-\\nself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to\\n“Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.” My\\nfriend tore it open and we all three read it together.\\nIt was dated at midnight of the preceding night\\nand ran in this way:\\n“My dearMr. Sherlock Holmes:\\n“You really did it very well. You took\\nme in completely. Until after the alarm\\nof ﬁre, I had not a suspicion. But then,\\nwhen I found how I had betrayed my-\\nself, I began to think. I had been warned\\nagainst you months ago. I had been\\ntold that if the King employed an agent\\nit would certainly be you. And your\\naddress had been given me. Yet, with\\nall this, you made me reveal what you\\nwanted to know. Even after I became\\nsuspicious, I found it hard to think evil\\nof such a dear, kind old clergyman. But,\\nyou know, I have been trained as an\\nactress myself. Male costume is noth-\\ning new to me. I often take advantage\\nof the freedom which it gives. I sent\\nJohn, the coachman, to watch you, ran\\nup stairs, got into my walking-clothes,\\nas I call them, and came down just as\\nyou departed.\\n“Well, I followed you to your door,\\nand so made sure that I was really an\\nobject of interest to the celebrated Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes. Then I, rather im-\\nprudently, wished you good-night, and\\nstarted for the Temple to see my hus-\\nband.\\n“We both thought the best resource\\nwas ﬂight, when pursued by so\\nformidable an antagonist; so you will\\nﬁnd the nest empty when you call to-\\nmorrow. As to the photograph, your\\nclient may rest in peace. I love and am\\n12\\nloved by a better man than he. The\\nKing may do what he will without hin-\\ndrance from one whom he has cruelly\\nwronged. I keep it only to safeguard\\nmyself, and to preserve a weapon which\\nwill always secure me from any steps\\nwhich he might take in the future. I\\nleave a photograph which he might care\\nto possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sher-\\nlock Holmes,\\n— “Very truly yours,\\n“Irene Norton, n´ee Adler.”\\n“What a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the\\nKing of Bohemia, when we had all three read this\\nepistle. “Did I not tell you how quick and resolute\\nshe was? Would she not have made an admirable\\nqueen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my\\nlevel?”\\n“From what I have seen of the lady she seems in-\\ndeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty,”\\nsaid Holmes coldly. “I am sorry that I have not been\\nable to bring your Majesty’s business to a more suc-\\ncessful conclusion.”\\n“On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King;\\n“nothing could be more successful. I know that her\\nword is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe\\nas if it were in the ﬁre.”\\n“I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.”\\n“I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me\\nin what way I can reward you. This ring—” He\\nslipped an emerald snake ring from his ﬁnger and\\nheld it out upon the palm of his hand.\\n“Your Majesty has something which I should\\nvalue even more highly,” said Holmes.\\n“You have but to name it.”\\n“This photograph!”\\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\\n“Irene’s photograph!” he cried. “Certainly, if\\nyou wish it.”\\n“I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to\\nbe done in the matter. I have the honour to wish\\nyou a very good-morning.” He bowed, and, turning\\naway without observing the hand which the King\\nhad stretched out to him, he set off in my company\\nfor his chambers.\\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened\\nto affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the\\nbest plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a\\nwoman’s wit. He used to make merry over the clev-\\nerness of women, but I have not heard him do it of\\nlate. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when\\nhe refers to her photograph, it is always under the\\nhonourable title of the woman.\\n13\\n'"
